## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick Priewe, a german (Karlsruhe-based) aspiring developer / data analyst! 

I am currently on a path to build experteer in the field of data science.
So far, I'm kinda falling in love with Python, and made my first (not so tiny) steps already using that fantastic technology!

Professionaly, I am interested in the fields of energy economics and software. So far having gathered professional experience in product ownership and requirements engineering in SCRUM (software-focused, german SME doing CRM) and project management (said SME, as well as coordinating strategic projects in a big german energy supplier). Currently (as well as in the near future) aspiring to get deeper into technology and working for that purpose!

Recently.... I finished my first SQL-project! I set up a small database (using dummy data) containing various tables and relations that allow to map the processes of a small retail company. I implemented user workflows (mostly relying on DDL, DML, TCL) and triggers & procedures. Views that assist the workflows were created as well.

Recently.... finished my first python-project, a small (terminal-based) 2d-RPG (wander a small map, encounter enemies in round based fights, deploy "powerpals", your small fighters). The game is terminal-based (i.e., text-based) but containing a fancy small map that you can indeed interactively roam as a player! It was lots of fun and I'm actually pretty proud of what I achieved in barely two weeks programming time in the project (which was my first one so far)!!

Recently.... I finished my second python project! This one led me further towards my true purpose of learning python: work with, examine, and visualize data!! I boosted my skills in the python packages numpy, pandas, plotly express, and dash (also including pickle and getting introduced to html-formatting)! I came up with several awesome dashboards, the project as a whole is included in jupyter notebooks (which are the state of the art medium fÃ¼r data analysises currently).

Coming up soon.... I will finish my first machine learning project! 

Eventually.... I am eager to contribute to a sustainable future of the german energy sector with my skills in data and ML!

Feel free to have a look at my codes, contact me anytime!

Patrick
